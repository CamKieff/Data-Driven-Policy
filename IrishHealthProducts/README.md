# Extracting Approved Drugs from the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) of Ireland

A web scraper case study using `rvest` to extract relevant health product information from over 10,000 web pages into a single CSV file.

Data is extracted from: http://www.hpra.ie/homepage/medicines/medicines-information/find-a-medicine

This work was inspired by the article [Web scraping tutorial in R][https://towardsdatascience.com/web-scraping-tutorial-in-r-5e71fd107f32] by Jose Roberto Ayala Solares.
