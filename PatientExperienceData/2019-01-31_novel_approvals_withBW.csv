Meningococcal infection may become rapidly life-threatening or fatal if not recognized and treated early [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Comply with the most current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations for meningococcal vaccination in patients with complement deficiencies. Immunize patients with meningococcal vaccines at least 2 weeks prior to administering the first dose of ULTOMIRIS, unless the risks of delaying ULTOMIRIS therapy outweigh the risk of developing a meningococcal infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) for additional guidance on the management of the risk of meningococcal infection]. Vaccination reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of meningococcal infections. Monitor patients for early signs of meningococcal infections and evaluate immediately if infection is suspected. ULTOMIRIS is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). Under the ULTOMIRIS REMS, prescribers must enroll in the program [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Enrollment in the ULTOMIRIS REMS program and additional information are available by telephone: 1-844-259-6783 or at www.ultomirisrems.com.

One clinical trial patient died from intracranial hemorrhage. TEGSEDI is contraindicated in patients with a platelet count below 100 x 109/L [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Prior to starting TEGSEDI, obtain a platelet count [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. During treatment, monitor platelet counts weekly if values are 75 x 109/L or greater, and more frequently if values are less than 75 x 109/L [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. If a patient develops signs or symptoms of thrombocytopenia, obtain a platelet count as soon as possible. The patient should not receive additional TEGSEDI unless a platelet count is determined to be interpretable and acceptable by a medical professional [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Following discontinuation of treatment for any reason, continue to monitor platelet count for 8 weeks, or longer if platelet counts are less than 100 x 109/L, to verify that platelet counts remain above 75 x 109/L [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Glomerulonephritis TEGSEDI can cause glomerulonephritis that may require immunosuppressive treatment and may result in dialysis-dependent renal failure. One clinical trial patient who developed glomerulonephritis and did not receive immunosuppressive treatment remained dialysis-dependent. In clinical trials, cases of glomerulonephritis were accompanied by nephrotic syndrome, which can have manifestations of edema, hypercoagulability with venous or arterial thrombosis, and increased susceptibility to infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. TEGSEDI should generally not be initiated in patients with urinary protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) of 1000 mg/g or higher [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Prior to starting TEGSEDI, measure the serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR), and perform a urinalysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. During treatment, monitor serum creatinine, eGFR urinalysis, and UPCR every every two weeks. TEGSEDI should not be given to patients who develop a UPCR of 1000 mg/g or higher, or eGFR below 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2, pending further evaluation of the cause. If a dose is held, once eGFR increases to =45 mL/minute/1.73 m2, UPCR decreases to below 1000 mg/g, or the underlying cause of the decline in renal function is corrected, weekly dosing may be reinitiated. In patients with UPCR of 2000 mg/g or higher, perform further evaluation for acute glomerulonephritis, as clinically indicated. If acute glomerulonephritis is confirmed, TEGSEDI should be permanently discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. TEGSEDI REMS Program Because of the risks of serious bleeding caused by severe thrombocytopenia and because of glomerulonephritis, both of which require frequent monitoring, TEGSEDI is available only through a restricted distribution program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the TEGSEDI REMS Program [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. WARNING: THROMBOCYTOPENIA AND GLOMERULONEPHRITIS See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. If a serious infection develops, interrupt OLUMIANT until the infection is controlled. Reported infections include: Active tuberculosis, which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Patients should be tested for latent tuberculosis before initiating OLUMIANT and during therapy. Treatment for latent infection should be considered prior to OLUMIANT use. Invasive fungal infections, including candidiasis and pneumocystosis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. Bacterial, viral, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens. The risks and benefits of treatment with OLUMIANT should be carefully considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection.

Administer the initial dose of Palynziq under the supervision of a healthcare provider equipped to manage anaphylaxis, and closely observe patients for at least 60 minutes following injection. Prior to self-injection, confirm patient competency with self-administration, and patient’s and observer’s (if applicable) ability to recognize signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and administer auto-injectable epinephrine, if needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Consider having an adult observer for patients who may need assistance in recognizing and managing anaphylaxis during Palynziq treatment. If an adult observer is needed, the observer should be present during and for at least 60 minutes after Palynziq administration, should be able to administer auto-injectable epinephrine, and call for emergency medical support upon its use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Prescribe auto-injectable epinephrine to all patients treated with Palynziq. Prior to the first dose, instruct the patient and observer (if applicable) how to recognize the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, how to properly administer auto-injectable epinephrine, and to seek immediate medical care upon its use. Instruct patients to carry auto-injectable epinephrine with them at all times during treatment with Palynziq [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Consider the risks and benefits of readministering Palynziq following an episode of anaphylaxis. If the decision is made to readminister Palynziq, readminister the first dose under the supervision of a healthcare provider equipped to manage anaphylaxis and closely observe the patient for at least 60 minutes following the dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
