One clinical trial patient died from intracranial hemorrhage. TEGSEDI is contraindicated in patients with a platelet count below 100 x 109/L [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Prior to starting TEGSEDI, obtain a platelet count [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. During treatment, monitor platelet counts weekly if values are 75 x 109/L or greater, and more frequently if values are less than 75 x 109/L [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. If a patient develops signs or symptoms of thrombocytopenia, obtain a platelet count as soon as possible. The patient should not receive additional TEGSEDI unless a platelet count is determined to be interpretable and acceptable by a medical professional [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Following discontinuation of treatment for any reason, continue to monitor platelet count for 8 weeks, or longer if platelet counts are less than 100 x 109/L, to verify that platelet counts remain above 75 x 109/L [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Glomerulonephritis TEGSEDI can cause glomerulonephritis that may require immunosuppressive treatment and may result in dialysis-dependent renal failure. One clinical trial patient who developed glomerulonephritis and did not receive immunosuppressive treatment remained dialysis-dependent. In clinical trials, cases of glomerulonephritis were accompanied by nephrotic syndrome, which can have manifestations of edema, hypercoagulability with venous or arterial thrombosis, and increased susceptibility to infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. TEGSEDI should generally not be initiated in patients with urinary protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) of 1000 mg/g or higher [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Prior to starting TEGSEDI, measure the serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR), and perform a urinalysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. During treatment, monitor serum creatinine, eGFR urinalysis, and UPCR every every two weeks. TEGSEDI should not be given to patients who develop a UPCR of 1000 mg/g or higher, or eGFR below 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2, pending further evaluation of the cause. If a dose is held, once eGFR increases to =45 mL/minute/1.73 m2, UPCR decreases to below 1000 mg/g, or the underlying cause of the decline in renal function is corrected, weekly dosing may be reinitiated. In patients with UPCR of 2000 mg/g or higher, perform further evaluation for acute glomerulonephritis, as clinically indicated. If acute glomerulonephritis is confirmed, TEGSEDI should be permanently discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. TEGSEDI REMS Program Because of the risks of serious bleeding caused by severe thrombocytopenia and because of glomerulonephritis, both of which require frequent monitoring, TEGSEDI is available only through a restricted distribution program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the TEGSEDI REMS Program [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. WARNING: THROMBOCYTOPENIA AND GLOMERULONEPHRITIS See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.
